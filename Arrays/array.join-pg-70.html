      var veggies = ["Pumpkin", "Ginger", "Tomato", "Garlic"];
      document.getElementById("array-demo").innerHTML = veggies.join(" - ");
      // the .join() method is very similar to the .toString() method because both convert the array into a string, the key difference lies in that the .join() method allows you to add a seperator which in this case is ' - '.
