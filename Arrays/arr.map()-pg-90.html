    <p>This is JavaScript Array.map()</p>
    <p>
      I will create a new array by applying the function on all array elements.
    </p>
    <p id="demo90"></p>
    <script>
      var nums1 = [12345, 7674, 3449, 12316, 9900025];

      var nums2 = nums1.map(FunctionM); // .map() method is used to make new array by performing an individual function on all array elements. It does not execute the function for the elements that are void of values, and it does not change the original form of the array

      document.getElementById("demo90").innerHTML = nums2;

      function FunctionM(Mvalue, Mindex, Marray) {
        return Mvalue + 10;
      }
      // the function that I have included in the code takes three arguments; the first argument is for value, the second is for index, and the third is for the array as a whole. If you need to work with only one parameter, you may omit the rest of the parameters
