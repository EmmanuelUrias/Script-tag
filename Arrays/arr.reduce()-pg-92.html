    <p>This is JavaScript Array.reduce()</p>
    <p>
      The following program will create a new array by reducing all array
      elements that tend to pass the test.
    </p>
    <p id="demo789"></p>
    <script>
      var nums = [45890, 17, 3459, 18, 2, 6, 23416, 87625];

      var over20 = nums.reduce(FunctionZ, 200000); // The most amazing thing about the reduce() method is that it takes an additional value to start with unlike other methods
      // reduce() method makes a function call to all the array elements and produces one value, and runs from left to right in the array

      document.getElementById("demo789").innerHTML = over20;

      function FunctionZ(Total, valueF) {
        return Total + valueF;
      }
