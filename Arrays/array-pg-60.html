      When looking at the code it looks like the carsTextDisplay variable should
      be an empty string but when we declare it outside the for loop and update
      it within the for loop it gets it's new value and we can display the
      correct data to the page
    </p>
    <p>
      You could define the carsTextDisplay variable outside of the loop and
      update the innerHTML property once the loop has finished executing, like
      this:<br />
      let carsTextDisplay = ""; <br />
      for (let i = 0; i &lt; carsforsale.length; i++) { <br />
      carsTextDisplay += carsforsale[i] + " "; } <br />
      document.getElementById("array-demo").innerHTML = carsTextDisplay;
    </p>
    <script>
      var carsforsale = ["Honda", "Toyota", "GTX", "Ford"];

      //For example, on the first iteration of the loop, 'i' will have a value of 0 and the loop will execute the code inside the curly braces. On the second iteration, 'i' will have a value of 1, and so on, until 'i' is equal to carsforsale.length - 1, at which point the loop will stop executing.-
      //The length property is a useful way to determine the size of an array, and it can be used in loops or other operations to iterate over the elements of the array.
      // carsforsale.length refers to the length of the carsforsale array, which is the number of elements in the array.
      let carsTextDisplay = "";

      for (let i = 0; i < carsforsale.length; i++) {
        carsTextDisplay += carsforsale[i] + ", ";
      }

      document.getElementById("array-demo").innerHTML = carsTextDisplay;
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
