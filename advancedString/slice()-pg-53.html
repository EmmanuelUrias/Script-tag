      This String property will answer the question about the inner string of
      your string:
    </p>
    <p id="string-demo"></p>
    <script>
      var msgX = "I am about to leave for 'New York' to start my own business.";
      var msgY = msgX.slice(23, 34); // With this method we get 'New York' but if we remove the 34(which is the index) we get 'New York' to start my own business. this is because we would be missing the endpoint
      document.getElementById("string-demo").innerHTML = msgY;
    </script>
  </body>
