      IMPORTANT NOTE: If you notice the results of the two methods, namely
      search() and indexOf(), you will realize they are the same. They accept
      the same arguments and then respond with the same values. However,

      indexOf() method cannot take in powerful search values.

    <p id="string-demo"></p>
    <script>
      var msgX = "I am about to leave for 'New York' to start my own business.";
      var msgY = msgX.search("New York");
      document.getElementById("string-demo").innerHTML = msgY;
