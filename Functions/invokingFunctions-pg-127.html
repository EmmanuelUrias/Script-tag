    <p>This is JavaScript Function</p>
    <p>
      My global function will return the product of different arguments. If you
      invoke FunctionXXX, you are actually invoking window.FunctionXXX. Both are
      the same. (x , y):
    </p>
    <p id="demo77"></p>
    <p>
      The function in the example has no connection to any of the objects. This
      brings us to the question as to why the execution was successful in the
      absence of an object. The answer is that JavaScript has a default global
      object. As JavaScript walks side by side with HTML, the default object in
      HTML is the HTML page itself therefore the function is used by the HTML
      page. Inside of a browser, the object is the window of your visitor's
      browser so the function turns into a window function.
    </p>
    <script>
      function FunctionXXX(x, y) {
        return x * y;
      }

      document.getElementById("demo77").innerHTML = FunctionXXX(12, 89);
      //My global function will return the product of different arguments. If you invoke FunctionXXX, you are actually invoking window.FunctionXXX. Both are the same.
    </script>
    <p>
      The practice of invoking is common but it is not considered good. Methods,
      global variables, and functions may land you in naming conflicts and bugs
      in a global object.<br />
      In JavaScript, if you see the this keyword, you should understand that it
      is an object that is the owner of the current code. When you use it in a
      function, the value of this is the object which owns the function. This is
      not actually a variable but a keyword. You cannot change its value.
