      const a = (a, b) => a * b;

      document.getElementById("demo123").innerHTML = a(50, 50);

      Arrow functions are not suited well to define methods pertaining to
      objects. These functions lack the hoisting feature. You must define an
      arrow function before you put it to use in a program. Without the
      definition, you will see an error in the program. The use of const in
      arrow functions is considered a safer method instead of using the var
      keyword. This is because a function expression always has a constant
      value. You should remove the curly braces and the return keyword if only
      the function consists of a single statement.

    <p>
      const obj = {<br />
      name: "Alice",<br />
      greet: () => {<br />
      console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);<br />
      }<br />
      };<br />
      <br />
      obj.greet(); // Output: "Hello, my name is undefined"
    </p>
    <p>
      The arrow function doesn't have the 'this' value. If we used a regular
      function it would display the name in the console.log()
