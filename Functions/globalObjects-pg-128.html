      In JavaScript, global objects are objects that are available in the global
      scope. This means that you can access these objects from any script or
      function in your code, without having to explicitly declare or import
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are several built-in global objects in JavaScript, including:<br />
      <br />
      Math: This object provides mathematical functions and properties, such as
      Math.PI and Math.sin().<br />
      <br />
      Date: This object provides functions for working with dates and times.<br />
      <br />
      String: This object provides functions for working with strings, such
      as<br />
      String.prototype.substr() and String.prototype.toLowerCase().<br />
      <br />
      Array: This object provides functions for working with arrays, such as<br />
      Array.prototype.push() and Array.prototype.sort().
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to these built-in global objects, you can also create your own
      global objects by declaring variables in the global scope. For example:<br />
      <br />
      var myGlobalObject = {};
    </p>
    <p>
      Keep in mind that using global objects can lead to conflicts and namespace
      pollution, so it's generally a good idea to avoid creating global objects
      unless absolutely necessary. Instead, consider using modules or other
      techniques to manage your code.

      var Y = FunctionDD();
      function FunctionDD() {
        return this;
      }
      document.getElementById("demo777").innerHTML = Y;
    </script>
