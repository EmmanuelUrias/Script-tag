It is initialized to -Infinity, which is a special value in JavaScript that represents a negative number that is greater than any other number.

      The parameters, when a function is invoked, act as the arguments of a
      function. You can pass on JavaScript arguments by values. The function has
      to know the values and not the locations of the arguments. If a specific
      function makes a change in the value of an argument, it will not change
      the parameter's original value. The changes you make to function arguments
      cannot be seen or used out of a function's restrictions.
