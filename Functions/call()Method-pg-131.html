      The following example will call the fullName method of a person by using
      it on another person:
    </p>
    <p id="demo90"></p>
    <p>
      The call() method is flexible enough to include many arguments to the
      function to make it more interactive and useful.

      // The call() method in JavaScript is like a predefined method that you can use to invoke a method. You can use a method that another object owns.
      var man = {
        completeName: function (msg, celebrationTrademark) {
          return (
            this.Namef +
            " " +
            this.Namel +

            " " +

        },
      };
      var man1 = { Namef: "Christiano", Namel: "Ronaldo" };
      var man2 = {

        man1,
        "is the best soccer player in the world",
        celebrationTrademark
      );
      // Cannot arguments into the call method above without first defining them in the object method first
