    <p>I will integrate a <b>break</b> statement to the for loop.</p>
    <p id="demo9"></p>
    <script>
      var msg = "";
      var YY;

      for (YY = 0; YY < 10; YY++) {
        if (YY === 5) {
          continue;
        }
        msg += "The next digit is " + YY + "<br>";
      }

      document.getElementById("demo9").innerHTML = msg;
    </script>
    <p>
      The loop broke at point 5 and then continued. You can see that the only
      number that is missing in the results is number 5. The continue statement
      is suitable for skipping one iteration of a loop. The break statement has
      only one purpose: to give you a jump out of a switch or a loop. You can
      use the break statement to make a jump out of a code block.
