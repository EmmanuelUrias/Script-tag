    <p>Learning JavaScript For/In Loop</p>
    <p>Our for/in loops through all the properties of the object car.</p>
    <p id="demo1"></p>
    <script>
      var msg = "";

      var car = { name: "Honda", model: "Vezel", year: 2020, make: "Japan" };

      var YY;

      for (YY in car) {
        // This deconstructs the object and we use the first parameter to use as an index of the second parameter which is an object
        // 'YY' is the variable we assigned to the key value pairs. We will only display the value of the properties.
        msg += car[YY] + " ";
      }

      document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = msg;
    </script>
    <p>
      In this example, the for in loop tends to iterate through the object car.
      With each iteration it returns the key (YY). The program uses the key to
      access a specific value of the key that is car[YY].
