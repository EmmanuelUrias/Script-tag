    <p>These are JavaScript For In Loops</p>
    <p>
      I will show how the for/in statement loop through and over Array values.
    </p>
    <p>
      The for/in loop is special because you can pair it up with an array and it
      will loop through the properties of the array just like it did with the
      properties of the object.
    </p>
    <p id="demo5"></p>
    <script>
      var msg = "";
      var nums = [5545, 24, 139, 6716, 4425];
      var YY;
      for (YY in nums) {
        msg += nums[YY] + "<br>";
      }
      document.getElementById("demo5").innerHTML = msg;
    </script>
    <p>
      You should drop the idea of using for in over the array loops if you are
      keen on the order of the index. It is important and better for you to use
      a for of loop, for loop, and the Array.forEach() whenever you think the
      order is special.
