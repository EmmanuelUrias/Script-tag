    <p>
      In this example, I will be declaring a Variable by Using the const keyword
    </p>
    <p id="const-demo"></p>
    <script>
      var xyz = 15;
      // The value of xyz is 15
      {
        const xyz = 1;
        // The value of xyz is 1
      }
      // The value of xyz is 15
      document.getElementById("const-demo").innerHTML = xyz;

      //IMPORTANT NOTE: The keyword const does not define constant values.-
      //In reality, it defines constant references to the values you use in the equation. That is why you cannot change the primitive values of constants. However, you can change properties.
