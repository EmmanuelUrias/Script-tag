    <p>Learning JavaScript Objects</p>
    <p id="objects-demo"></p>
    <p>
      The objects in JavaScript have curly braces around them. You have to write
      the properties of objects in the form of <mark>name:value pairs</mark>.
      You may separate them with commas. Objects are treated as emperors in the
      world of JavaScript. If you have a thorough concept of objects, you can
      understand JavaScript well.
    </p>
    <p>
      an object is a collection of properties, where a property is an
      association between a name (also known as a key) and a value. Properties
      can be of any data type, including simple types like strings, boolean and
      numbers, and more complex types like arrays and other objects. Properties
      can also have methods, which are functions that are associated with an
      object.
    </p>
    <p>
      <mark
        >Math and dates are objects as well. Arrays and regular expressions are
        objects. Functions also are objects. Except for primitives, everything
        in JavaScript is an object.</mark
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Objects may be filled up with variables. An object in JavaScript is a
      collection of values that are named. These named values are known as
      properties. You saw their applications in the chapter on functions. You
      can perform certain actions named as methods on different objects. These
      properties may be primitive, like objects and functions. An object method
      contains the definition of a function, and you can create and define an
      object in JavaScript. You can use a number of methods to do that. You can
      achieve this purpose to create an object, namely literal. The keyword new
      is used for the creation. Object literal is considered the easiest way to
      create an object in JavaScript. By using the object literal, you can do
      that using one statement only.
