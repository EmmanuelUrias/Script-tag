    <p>This is the JavaScript Class</p>
    <p>
      I will show you how to create and use the JavaScript Class on your
      website.

      If you want to create a class inheritance, you have to add the extends
      keyword to the class. The extends keyword transfers all the methods to the
      inherited class.

      class LuxCars {
        constructor(cname, cyear, cmake, cmodel, ccolor) {
          this.cname = cname;
          this.cyear = cyear;
          this.cmake = cmake;
          this.cmodel = cmodel;
          this.ccolor = ccolor;
        }
        present() {
          return "We have a " + this.cname + " for sale";
        }
      }

      class Ecar extends LuxCars {
        constructor(battery, model) {
          super(battery);
          this.cmodel = model;
        }
        show() {
          return this.present() + ". It is a " + this.cmodel + " model.";
        }
      }

      let Car2 = new Ecar("Tesla", 2010);

      document.getElementById("demo778").innerHTML = Car2.show();

      The super() method in the above code refers to the parent class. When you
      call this method in the constructor method, you get access to the parent
      class's properties and methods. The sole purpose of inheritance is that it
      keeps you from writing the same code repeatedly. You can write a class
      once and use its methods and properties by creating child classes.
      Whenever you create a new class, there is no need to write from the start.
      It saves time and space.
