    <p>This is the JavaScript Class</p>
    <p>
      I will show you how to create and use the JavaScript Class on your
      website.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can send off parameters to your JavaScript classes. I will pass the
      age and year parameters to JavaScript class. See the following example.
