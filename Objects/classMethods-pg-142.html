    <p>This is the JavaScript Class</p>
    <p>
      I will show you how to create and use the JavaScript Class on your
      website.
    </p>
    <p>
      The procedure to write and execute class methods is the same as writing
      and creating an object. You have to use the class keyword and the
      constructor() method when you are adding a new method to the class. The
      total number of methods that you can add does not have an upper cap. You
      can add any number at will. Let us add a new method to declare the age of
      the car. JavaScript calculates the age of the car by using the current
      date as a reference. For example, if a car is produced in 2020, the
      program will display the age as 1 year old because the current year is
      2021.
