    <p>
      JavaScript Properties are the most important parts of objects. Each object
      has a value named as a property. Each object is built on a set of
      unordered properties. You can change them, add more to them or delete
      them. However, some of them are read-only.

      var msg = "";

      var man1 = { namef: "Lionel", namel: "Messi", agem: 33 };

      man1.nationality = "Argentinian";
      // this is how we add properties to objects without actually going into the object to change it.

      // var Y;
      //you can comment out the line above since we end up defining Y is the paramter of the for in loop

      for (Y in man1) {
        msg += man1[Y] + " ";
      }
      document.getElementById("demo555").innerHTML = msg;
