      The javaScript date feature is interesting to learn. When you are creating
      a new website, you need the date feature to integrate into your web page
      so that your visitors can see. It is also helpful in regulating the
      shipping time and other details. By default, the output of the date
      feature in JavaScript is displayed as per the browser's time zone. The
      display is in the form of a complete text string. You can create different
      objects to include in the display of the date. The objects may be year,
      month, hours, seconds, and milliseconds. You can add more information as
      your need. You can use the new Date() method to create a new data object
      to display the browser's current date and time.
