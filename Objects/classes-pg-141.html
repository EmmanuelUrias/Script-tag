    <p>This is the JavaScript Class</p>
    <p>
      I will show you how to create and use the JavaScript Class on your
      website.
    </p>
    <p>
      JavaScript is also known as a prototype-based language. Every object in
      this language keeps a hidden and internal property known as [[Prototype]].
      You can use it to extend the methods and properties of the objects you
      create in the language. You can use the keyword class for the creation of
      a class. Another important method to add to your class is the
      constructor() method. Just as we added properties to objects, we can add
      properties to classes. A class itself is not an object but a template to
      create objects and work with them on web browsers.

      class LuxCars {
        // ^ pretty cool :)
        constructor(cname, cyear, cmake, cmodel, ccolor) {
          this.cname = cname;
          this.cyear = cyear;
          this.cmake = cmake;
          this.cmodel = cmodel;
          this.ccolor = ccolor;
        }
      }
      Car1 = new LuxCars("Ford", 2020, "USA", "Mustang", "Blue");
      document.getElementById("demo777").innerHTML =
        Car1.cname +
        " " +
        Car1.cyear +
        " " +
        Car1.cmake +
        " " +
        Car1.cmodel +
        " " +
        Car1.ccolor;
      Car2 = new LuxCars("BMW", 2010, "Germany", "K45", "Silver");
      document.getElementById("demo778").innerHTML =
        Car2.cname +
        " " +
        Car2.cyear +
        " " +
        Car2.cmake +
        " " +
        Car2.cmodel +
        " " +
        Car2.ccolor;
      Car3 = new LuxCars("Mercedes", 2021, "Germany", "S-Class", "Black");
      document.getElementById("demo779").innerHTML =
        Car3.cname +
        " " +
        Car3.cyear +
        " " +
        Car3.cmake +
        " " +
        Car3.cmodel +
        " " +
        Car3.ccolor;
    </script>
    <p>
      I have created three different objects by using the same LuxCars class.
      Classes offer the easiest methods to create and deploy objects to work.
      This program can be helpful to you if you are running a car showroom and
      you need a website to reach out to customers. One single class allows you
      to create unlimited objects of different cars. Once you create the class,
      all you need is to fill it up with the properties and display them on your
      website. When a new object comes into being, the constructor method is
      called upon and run automatically. This method is special. You must write
      the clear spelling ‘constructor.’ When you create a new object in a class,
      the method executes automatically, saving your time. This method starts
      the properties of objects.
